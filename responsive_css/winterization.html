            <h2>Preparing Your Garden for Winter</h2>
            <p> As the growing season comes to an end, it's important to take steps to prepare your garden for the winter months. Proper winterization can help protect your plants and soil, 
                ensuring a healthy and productive garden in the spring. </p>

                 <p>The first step in preparing your garden for winter is to prune and pull up any dead plants at the end of the season. Weed out any plants that are perennials to make room for 
                    planting in the spring. Prune back all bushes and shrubs at the end of the summer. Sometime before August is best, to 
                ensure that the trim doesn't prevent future growth. This will give the plants time to grow a bit more before the cold sets in. </p>

               <p>The next priority before the cold season is to insulate your plants. There are various methods and materials that can be useful in this. 
                I reccomend researching the best type for your specific plantsto determine how much protection they need. Some plants may only require a 
                a pile of fall leaves, while others may benefit from straw, mulch, or even garden fabric for extra insulation. Be sure to cover the root zones 
                and avoid piling material directly against stems to prevent rot.
