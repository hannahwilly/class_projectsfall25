        <h2>Gardening Options Year-Round</h2>
        <hr>
         <p> While many people only consider planting in the spring, there are actually a number of vegetables 
            that can be planted in late summer or early fall for a fall harvest as well as certain plants that 
            can be grown indoors over the winter. Personally, I have had success growing pumpkins in the fall, and 
            I am planning to try growing lettuce indoors over the winter. Indoor herbs are also a good option for
             winter growing. Gardening year round is possible with a bit of planning and research. Its a great hobby 
            to have, and it is rewarding to be able to grow your own food and see something green even in the cold 
            winter months.

            <h3>Winter Gardening</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> While outdoor gardening is not really an option in the winter in colder climates, 
                there are still a number of options for indoor gardening. Herbs are a great option 
                for indoor gardening, as they do not require a lot of space and can be grown on a 
                sunny windowsill. Lettuce and other leafy greens can also be grown indoors with the 
                right setup. There are a number of kits available online that provide everything you 
                need to get started with indoor gardening.
