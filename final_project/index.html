    <h2>Know You!</h2>
    <p>The name "know you" originated from a joke I had with my friends and family. When they complimented me on my art skills, I would respond with, "NO YOU!" While it started out as a joke, I have come to realize the importance of knowing who I am, expressing myself and encouraging others to do the same. Making art has been a means I've used to learn who I am, explore the world around me and get to know the interworkings of my own mind. I not only hope to share what I make, but to encourage others to do the same.   </p>
