        <p>The painting shown above represents one of my most significant projects to date. I made this piece during my time serving with an organization called Eurorelief in Lesvos, Greece. Every year hundreds of people make the dangerous trip in a raft from Turkey to the island of Lesvos where they are then held in a camp until they can get their asylum papers and passport registration processed. The months I spent in the camp were some of the most impactful experiences of my life. I love to make work that brings awareness to important issues and the needs of others.

        <p>The bus pictured above was also a project I worked on in the camp. Even making small additions of color and beauty to the prison-like camp was a way to spread hope. </p>

        <p>This painting was made using fabric scraps I collected from around the sewing machines where the women would work tirelessly to patch up the only clothes they had brought with them from their country.</p>
